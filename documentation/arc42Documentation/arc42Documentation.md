**About arc42**

arc42, the template for documentation of software and system
architecture.

Template Version 8.2 EN. (based upon AsciiDoc version), January 2023

Created, maintained and © by Dr. Peter Hruschka, Dr. Gernot Starke and
contributors. See <https://arc42.org>.

::: note
This version of the template contains some help and explanations. It is
used for familiarization with arc42 and the understanding of the
concepts. For documentation of your own system you use better the
*plain* version.

# Introduction and Goals {#section-introduction-and-goals}


## Requirements Overview {#_requirements_overview}
We want to create an event planer, to allow users to create their own events and also to join others. Other features are an integrated calender, usergroups and chats. For detailed information visit our blog (https://letseventproject.wordpress.com/) or documentation(https://github.com/Impolex/event_planer/tree/main/documentation).

# Constraints {#section-constraints}



## Technical-Constraints {#section-technical-constraints}
We work with Java and for our Databank we use MariaDB.
We want a Model-View-Controller pattern and code has to be reusable.

# Architecture Constraints {#section-architecture-constraints}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of
design and implementation decisions or decision about the development
process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and
are valid for whole organizations and companies.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design
decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints must
always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

Simple tables of constraints with explanations. If needed you can
subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and political
constraints and conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines,
documentation or naming conventions)

See [Architecture Constraints](https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/) in the
arc42 documentation.

# System Scope and Context {#section-system-scope-and-context}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system
(i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring
systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby
specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs
and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners
are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you
completely understand them.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

Various options:

-   Context diagrams

-   Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

See [Context and Scope](https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/) in the arc42
documentation.

## Business Context {#_business_context}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Specification of **all** communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...)
with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication
protocols.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the
environment of the system.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify
the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table. The title of the
table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of
the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

**\<Diagram or Table>**

**\<optionally: Explanation of external domain interfaces>**

## Technical Context {#_technical_context}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your
system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific
input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which
channel.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical
interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure
or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels
and input/output.

**\<Diagram or Table>**

**\<optionally: Explanation of technical interfaces>**

**\<Mapping Input/Output to Channels>**

# Solution Strategy {#section-solution-strategy}

A short summary of our technical decisions:
- Programming language Java
- Maria DB Data Bank server
- Github for documentation and code
- Wordpressblog for sharing our progress

We are using the Model-View-Controller pattern.

To guarantee the usability of our programm, we are planning on choosing random testers who are not in any way related to our project. This will show us how user friendly our Gui is and where and how we can improve it.

The security of the user data will be ensured by a strong and safe encryption algorythm.
# Building Block View {#section-building-block-view}

::: formalpara-title
**Content**
:::

The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system
into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers,
functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their
dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation. In analogy
to a house this is the *floor plan*.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure
understandable through abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract
level without disclosing implementation details.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and
white boxes (see figure below) and their descriptions.

![Hierarchy of building blocks](images/05_building_blocks-EN.png)

**Level 1** is the white box description of the overall system together
with black box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

**Level 2** zooms into some building blocks of level 1. Thus it contains
the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1,
together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

**Level 3** zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

See [Building Block View](https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/) in the
arc42 documentation.

## Whitebox Overall System {#_whitebox_overall_system}

Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the
following white box template. It contains

-   an overview diagram

-   a motivation for the decomposition

-   black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these
    we offer you alternatives:

    -   use *one* table for a short and pragmatic overview of all
        contained building blocks and their interfaces

    -   use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks
        according to the black box template (see below). Depending on
        your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text
        files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling
        tool).

-   (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the
    black box templates of a building block, but are very important for
    understanding the white box. Since there are so many ways to specify
    interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them. In the
    worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics,
    protocols, error handling, restrictions, versions, qualities,
    necessary compatibilities and many things more. In the best case you
    will get away with examples or simple signatures.

***\<Overview Diagram>***

Motivation

:   *\<text explanation>*

Contained Building Blocks

:   *\<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>*

Important Interfaces

:   *\<Description of important interfaces>*

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with
name and responsibility according to the following schema:

+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| **Name**              | **Responsibility**                            |
+=======================+===============================================+
| *\<black box 1>*      |  *\<Text>*                                    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| *\<black box 2>*      |  *\<Text>*                                    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate
black box template for every important building block . Its headline is
the name of the black box.

### \<Name black box 1> {#__name_black_box_1}

Here you describe \<black box 1> according the the following black box
template:

-   Purpose/Responsibility

-   Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs.
    This interfaces may include qualities and performance
    characteristics.

-   (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box,
    e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....

-   (Optional) directory/file location

-   (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to
    requirements).

-   (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

*\<Purpose/Responsibility>*

*\<Interface(s)>*

*\<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>*

*\<(Optional) Directory/File Location>*

*\<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>*

*\<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>*

### \<Name black box 2> {#__name_black_box_2}

*\<black box template>*

### \<Name black box n> {#__name_black_box_n}

*\<black box template>*

### \<Name interface 1> {#__name_interface_1}

...

### \<Name interface m> {#__name_interface_m}

## Level 2 {#_level_2}

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from
level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important
enough to justify such a detailed description. Please prefer relevance
over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or
volatile building blocks. Leave out normal, simple, boring or
standardized parts of your system

### White Box *\<building block 1>* {#_white_box_emphasis_building_block_1_emphasis}

...describes the internal structure of *building block 1*.

*\<white box template>*

### White Box *\<building block 2>* {#_white_box_emphasis_building_block_2_emphasis}

*\<white box template>*

...

### White Box *\<building block m>* {#_white_box_emphasis_building_block_m_emphasis}

*\<white box template>*

## Level 3 {#_level_3}

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from
level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.

### White Box \<\_building block x.1\_\> {#_white_box_building_block_x_1}

Specifies the internal structure of *building block x.1*.

*\<white box template>*

### White Box \<\_building block x.2\_\> {#_white_box_building_block_x_2}

*\<white box template>*

### White Box \<\_building block y.1\_\> {#_white_box_building_block_y_1}

*\<white box template>*

# Runtime View {#section-runtime-view}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the
system's building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

-   important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute
    them?

-   interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks
    cooperate with users and neighboring systems?

-   operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop

-   error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios
(sequences, workflows) is their **architectural relevance**. It is
**not** important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should
rather document a representative selection.

## \<Runtime Signing up> {#__runtime_scenario_1}

![](images/createuser.png)

- To create a user, the client sends a request to the server, which then creates the user by storing it to the database.

## \<Runtime Loging in> {#__runtime_scenario_2}

![](images/login.png)

- To login the client sends a request to the server. To server compares the credentials with the database. If successfull the servers provides an access token.

## \<Runtime Creating an event> {#__runtime_scenario_n}

![](images/createevent.png)

- To create an event, the client sends a request to the server, which then creates the event by storing it to the database.

# Deployment View {#section-deployment-view}

::: formalpara-title
**Content**
:::

The deployment view describes:

1.  technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with
    infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments,
    computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other
    infrastructure elements and

2.  mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure
    elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development
environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you
should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as
distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or
container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors
and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those
elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of
your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and
describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Software does not run without hardware. This underlying infrastructure
can and will influence a system and/or some cross-cutting concepts.
Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section
3.2. as technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box.
In this section one can zoom into this black box using additional
deployment diagrams:

-   UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it,
    probably with nested diagrams, when your infrastructure is more
    complex.

-   When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams
    rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able
    to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

See [Deployment View](https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/) in the arc42
documentation.

## Infrastructure Level 1 {#_infrastructure_level_1}

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

-   distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments,
    computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between
    them

-   important justifications or motivations for this deployment
    structure

-   quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure

-   mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and
adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.

# Cross-cutting Concepts {#section-concepts}

::: formalpara-title
**Content**
:::

This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas
that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. They can
include many different topics, such as

-   models, especially domain models

-   architecture or design patterns

-   rules for using specific technology

-   principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (=
    cross-cutting) nature

-   implementation rules

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Concepts form the basis for *conceptual integrity* (consistency,
homogeneity) of the architecture. Thus, they are an important
contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks,
e.g. security or safety.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

The form can be varied:

-   concept papers with any kind of structure

-   cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the
    architecture views

-   sample implementations, especially for technical concepts

-   reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using
    Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

::: formalpara-title
**Structure**
:::

A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

-   Domain concepts

-   User Experience concepts (UX)

-   Safety and security concepts

-   Architecture and design patterns

-   \"Under-the-hood\"

-   development concepts

-   operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one
specific topic on this list.

![Possible topics for crosscutting
concepts](images/08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png)

See [Concepts](https://docs.arc42.org/section-8/) in the arc42
documentation.

## *\<Concept 2>* {#__emphasis_concept_2_emphasis}

*\<explanation>*

...

## *\<Concept n>* {#__emphasis_concept_n_emphasis}

*\<explanation>*

# Architecture Decisions {#section-design-decisions}

Letsevent follows a "Model-View-Controller" scheme, whereas the classes of the user interface define the "View", the database defines the "Model" and the functional classes define the "Controller". 
The reason behind this is a clear seperation between the elements, which allows working on an specific element, without impacting the other elements.

	Example: Usage of a different graphic framework

+ The user interface is not aware of the database's existance. It simply recieves the data to be displayed from the controller.
+ The database is not aware of the user interface's existance. It simply delivers the data which was requested by the controller or responds with an errors, should those occur.
# Quality Requirements {#section-quality-scenarios}

## Quality Tree {#_quality_tree}

![](https://github.com/Impolex/event_planer/blob/main/documentation/diagrams/architectureSignificantRequirements/png/qualityTree.png)

## Quality Scenarios {#_quality_scenarios}

-   Within 10 minutes, the user can complete the event creation process, after which, the event is saved in the database
- When the user creates an account, a hash algorithm is applied to the credentials before saving in the database
- After completing the software update, the development team can apply the update within 2 hours
- Should the database become unavailable, a message will be displayed to the user and the admins will be notified. Unavailability must not be more than 5h per week
- When the user requests the data of an event, the time between the request reaching the server and the answer leaving the server should be less than 5s

# Risks and Technical Debts {#section-technical-risks}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

"Risk management is project management for grown-ups" (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

See [Risks and Technical Debt](https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/) in
the arc42 documentation.

# Glossary {#section-glossary}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
multi-language teams.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

A table with columns \<Term> and \<Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42
documentation.

+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Term                  | Definition                                    |
+=======================+===============================================+
| *\<Term-1>*           | *\<definition-1>*                             |
